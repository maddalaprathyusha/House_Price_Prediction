# House_Price_Prediction
In this project, I developed a linear regression model to accurately predict house prices in the Boston Area. The dataset provided, named "housing_train.csv," consists of various attributes for each house, including houseId, price, area, bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, mainroad, guestroom, basement, hotwaterheating, airconditioning, parking, prefarea, and furnishing status.

With this dataset and a set of new houses stored in "housing_test.csv," our model generates a file named "predictions.csv," which contains the houseID and the corresponding predicted prices for each house.

By employing Linear Regression, our model achieved an impressive prediction accuracy of 70%.

This project was undertaken as part of the Edyst Internship Program
